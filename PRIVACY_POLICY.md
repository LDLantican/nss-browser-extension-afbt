## 1. Overview

This browser extension was developed by **NSS David** to help users transfer work order information from **AppFolio** to **Buildertrend** more efficiently.  
The extension runs entirely in your browser and does not send any data to external servers.

---

## 2. Information Collected

This extension **does not collect, transmit, or share** any personal or usage data with the developer or third parties.

The only information accessed and processed is:

- Work order details that already appear on your AppFolio account (such as number, address, description, city, state, and ZIP).
- Your Buildertrend login status (read-only, to confirm you’re logged in).

All processing happens locally within your browser.

---

## 3. Local Data Storage

Work orders that you choose to “save” are stored in your browser’s **local storage** (`chrome.storage.local`).  
This data is never uploaded or synced externally.  
You can clear this data anytime by using the extension’s **“Clear All”** option or by removing the extension.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

This extension does **not**:

- Send data to the developer, any external server, or third-party services.
- Use analytics, advertising, or tracking tools.
- Access data from any other websites or browser activity.

---

## 5. Permissions Used

The extension requests limited permissions only to:

- Access AppFolio and Buildertrend tabs for automation.
- Store and retrieve work order data locally (`storage` permission).

No additional permissions (e.g. cookies, browsing history, or network access) are used.

---

## 6. User Control

You remain in full control of all data handled by the extension.  
At any time, you may:

- Remove saved work orders.
- Disable or uninstall the extension.
- Clear all stored data through browser settings.

---

## 7. Updates to This Policy

If this Privacy Policy changes, an updated version will be published with a new effective date.  
Since the extension is shared as **unlisted**, users will be informed directly by the developer if major changes occur.
